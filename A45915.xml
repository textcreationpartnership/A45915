         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DOubtleſs, it would more conduce to the honour of Chriſt, the Peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and the Welfare of Souls, if Chriſtians would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at the leaſt in <hi>this;</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>live</hi> as becomes the Goſpel we all believe; than curiouſly <hi>diſpute,</hi> Why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? For nice tamperings with, and eager conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are apt rather to ſhake, than to ſtrengthen the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures.</hi> It may prove
<pb facs="tcp:65209:3"/>a Snare to the profane, or unſtable; who, when they ſhall ſee the <hi>Ground</hi> of their Belief, and Eternal Hopes, not to be <hi>agreed</hi> on after ſo many Ages, perhaps may be tempted <hi>to doubt,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their whole <hi>Profeſſion</hi> be not aery, and have <hi>no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, if ſome will attempt to diſplace the <hi>true One,</hi> and to juſtle in a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>ruinous Ground</hi> of Chriſtian Faith and Practice, a due <hi>regard</hi> to a matter of ſo great <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> may juſtifie an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance againſt ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a <hi>Commutation.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Baſis</hi> of Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſuffers from more than one ſort of Adverſaries. The injuries done to the Sacred Oracles of God by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Drollings, and perverſe Diſputings of Profane and Atheiſtical Men are too <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</hi> The <hi>Foundation of Faith</hi> has no part in the Value and Care of thoſe Men, who ſcorn <hi>Believing.</hi> But this <hi>Crew</hi> is abhorr'd by all, who have any ordinary ſenſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> or have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd even their <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Indeed, the danger is more <hi>ſly and ſpreading</hi> from thoſe who ſeem to be more ſerious, and <hi>Friends</hi> to Religion.</p>

            <p>Among ſuch, <hi>the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts</hi> undermine the Holy Scriptures by pretence to an <hi>extraordinary</hi> illuminating Conduct, and Incitations by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God.

            <p>That which is undertaken in the enſuing Papers, is an <hi>Enquiry</hi> after the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> and its beſt <hi>ſtrength,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Religious</hi> Affairs; as alſo the full <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Writings,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the ſacred <hi>Scriptures;</hi> in point of <hi>Conſervation,</hi> and <hi>Conveyance</hi> of what is committed to <hi>them:</hi>

                  <p>MAN is an active, capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creature; fitted for, and deſirous of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and furniſh'd with variety of means for the acquiſition of it. In general, we come to <hi>know</hi> things in a two-fold manner.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65209:10"/>
                  <p n="1">1. By the uſe, and upon the ſtrength of our <hi>own Faculties,</hi> by our <hi>Senſes,</hi> whoſe Senſations, when frequent and uniform, we call <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;</hi> by (a far more ſublime Principle) our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which judges of, corrects, and improves what is receiv'd by the <hi>Senſes;</hi> forms <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Apprehenſions,</hi> of them makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and of Propoſitions Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms; <hi>i. e.</hi> diſcourſes and elicites one Knowledge out of another. A great many Notions, Propoſitions, and Diſcourſes, relating to ſome comprehending <hi>Subject,</hi> and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Method,</hi> are call'd a <hi>Science,</hi> or an <hi>Art,</hi> according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Subject, and the <hi>Scope</hi> in treating of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We attain to knowledge by <hi>Intelligence from others,</hi> being content to ſee with their Eyes, and to hear with their Ears. And here the <hi>more eaſie</hi> Task is well to <hi>underſtand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> given by others, and which we take <hi>upon Truſt</hi> from them. The Knowledge and Aſſent yielded to thing, on this account, and relying thus <hi>on Teſtimony,</hi> is called <hi>Faith,</hi> or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65209:10"/>
                     <hi>Belief;</hi> which is different anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the diverſity of <hi>Teſtimonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> or that of God: And this has ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prerogative; that when once it is ſufficiently clear, that <hi>God</hi> has indeed <hi>affirm'd</hi> a thing to be, or not to be; the Underſtanding may, and ought to acquieſce in ſuch an Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation without any heſitancy. For God cannot lye, either <hi>ignorantly,</hi> or <hi>knowingly;</hi> becauſe He is of <hi>infinite knowledge</hi> and <hi>veracity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Teſtimony is <hi>humane,</hi> or that of Man; and the <hi>Credit of this</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <hi>below</hi> that of the former. 'Tis not alone poſſible, but too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily experienc'd, that Man is <hi>himſelf deceiv'd,</hi> and then deceives others; nay, often knowingly, and <hi>deſignedly deceives.</hi> Therefore <hi>Belief</hi> muſt be yielded to <hi>Humane Teſtimony,</hi> with ſome ſuſpence, and good <hi>warineſs</hi> Yet even <hi>Humane Teſtimony</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and has a conſiderable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:</hi> For it is of great <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Tradition (conſidered,</hi> not <hi>materially,</hi> or as the thing deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as to what it <hi>formally</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65209:11"/>is <hi>Teſtimony:</hi> For the Aſſent which it begets, is <hi>Belief;</hi> as <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> are the Effect of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> reſpectively. And whereas <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> may be of <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> Perſons; and of more Perſons, at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> or in times <hi>following</hi> one the other: Tradition is an <hi>Aggregation</hi> of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in a <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> of one upon the other: It is <hi>the delivery of a thing down from one Age to another, in a way of Witneſſing.</hi> By which it is diſtinguiſh'd from ſuch a <hi>deſcent</hi> of Opinions and Practices; in which they of the former, and of the following Age (perhaps) O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or Practiſe the ſame thing: But they do ſo for <hi>Reaſons</hi> taken from the <hi>thing it ſelf;</hi> and not meerly becauſe the <hi>former Age told</hi> the next Age, that the Age before them did ſo Opine or Practiſe. But <hi>Tradition</hi> imports, <hi>an expreſs'd or imply'd, and a ſucceſſive witneſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a thing by Fathers to their Children, and that as received from their Fathers; and ſo on, unto the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigine of the thing witneſſed to.</hi>

                  <p>Teſtimony and Tradition (which is a Branch of it) may be ſuppos'd to be us'd or alledged to a double purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may ſuppoſe it Appeal'd to as a <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> defining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Natures</hi> of Things, and the <hi>Verity</hi> of Propoſitions relating to them: As whether ſuch and ſuch <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> which concern Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or Mathematicks, in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Euclide,</hi> be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian be the <hi>true</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (meerly becauſe Chriſtians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be ſo.) In the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, Humane Teſtimony and Tradition, is not <hi>ſo concluding</hi> a Medium. The <hi>Determination,</hi> or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it is <hi>leſs valid,</hi> (unleſs, where there is a concurrent <hi>general At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation</hi> of Mankind;) nor is it <hi>ſo neceſſary</hi> (except where ſome <hi>peculiar</hi> occaſion <hi>obliges to truſt</hi> anothers Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility; as the caſe is of young <hi>Learners</hi> of a Science, to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Genius of which they are <hi>Strangers.</hi>) I ſaid,</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65209:12"/>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis <hi>leſs valid.</hi> For things do often ſo much retire themſelves, and require ſuch a quickneſs and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedneſs of Underſtanding, to penetrate them; and withal there is not alone a common ſhortneſs of mens Reaſon, but ſuch an expoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo to <hi>biaſſing diſadvantages,</hi> as render men much unqualified for Deferences, and the <hi>final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage</hi> of the <hi>Natures</hi> of Things, and of the <hi>Truth</hi> concerning them. Beſides, there is ſcarce an Opinion, but is countenanced by ſo many Votes; that if meer <hi>Teſtimony</hi> muſt ſway a man's Judgment, he muſt believe <hi>all,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Contradictions;</hi> or he muſt believe <hi>none.</hi> And as there is <hi>inconvenience;</hi> ſo,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There's no ſuch <hi>neceſſity</hi> to try the <hi>Natures</hi> of the Things at <hi>this Bar.</hi> For Man has an enquiring and diſcurſive Power, which being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſed, and improved, is able to pierce unto things, and to diſcover them even in their retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And each Science, Faculty, and Art, have their reſpective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Hypotheſes, and Axioms, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65209:12"/>which the <hi>truth</hi> of things in each may be examined; and unto which matters in controverſie may be, and uſually are devolved.</p>
                  <p>And Men commonly think it <hi>their Right</hi> to have a <hi>Liberty</hi> to diſcuſs things, and the Judgment of others concerning them: Becauſe tho' a Man be <hi>fallible</hi> as well as others, and may be far <hi>inferior</hi> to others in natural and acquired Abilities; yet he may be better ſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>his own diligence and freedom</hi> from Prepoſſeſſion, Paſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, than he can be of <hi>anothers;</hi> every Man being beſt acquainted with the temper and ſecrets of <hi>his own</hi> Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Humane Teſtimony and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, may be alledg'd (which is it's proper <hi>Verge</hi>) in point of <hi>Fact,</hi> and as depoſing about the <hi>Exiſtence of Things;</hi> and that they <hi>are</hi> or <hi>have been:</hi> As that there were ſuch Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Euclide;</hi> that they were the Authors of ſuch Writings, as are entitled to them: Or, that there were ſuch Perſons as Chriſt, and thoſe who publiſhed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65209:13"/>and propagated his Religion in the World; and that the Books which contain the Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, did come from thoſe firſt Preachers and Propagators of it. Againſt Teſtimony and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>the uſe</hi> of it, there lye not thoſe <hi>Exceptions,</hi> as did in the <hi>former</hi> conſideration of it. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is much <hi>more eaſie</hi> for Men to aſcertain themſelves about the <hi>Quòd ſit,</hi> and that things <hi>are</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Fact;</hi> than to ſound <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of Things; to deſcry their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herences with, and dependences on each other; how far they may be affirm'd of, and infer'd from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. 'Tis far more diſcernable, that ſome Seas ebb and ſlow, and in what time; than what the <hi>true Cauſe</hi> is of that reciprocal motion; that ſuch and ſuch Propoſitions <hi>are</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Euclide,</hi> than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the juſt <hi>meaning</hi> of them; or (which is more) <hi>the truth</hi> of them when underſtood. Very <hi>Senſe</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to ſatisfie in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that ſuch things <hi>are</hi> without the <hi>labour</hi> of the Underſtanding, and any <hi>operoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65209:13"/>Diſcourſe.</hi> Now, where is the <hi>more eaſineſs</hi> of knowing things, there is the <hi>leſs liableneſs</hi> to miſtakes: And a leſs liableneſs to, and therefore a <hi>leſs probability</hi> of miſtake in others, is one reaſon why <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> to give credit to their Intelligence the <hi>more ſecurely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mankind is <hi>forc'd</hi> to content themſelves with Information from <hi>Teſtimony</hi> in multitudes of Things, which their Curioſity, or the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of their Affairs do engage them to be ſatisfied in, and yet <hi>their own</hi> Senſe or Reaſon can give no proſpect of them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe many who never croſs'd, nor ſaw the Seas, muſt truſt <hi>others Relation;</hi> that there <hi>are</hi> ſuch places, as <hi>Paris, Rome, Conſtantinople,</hi> both the <hi>Indies;</hi> where theſe places lye, and what their circumſtances are. The reaſon why Men believe that they were born in ſuch a year; on, or about ſuch a day; and therefore that they are of ſuch an Age; that they were Baptiz'd, and that ſuch is their Name; is, that they are <hi>told ſo.</hi> 'Tis not poſſible to come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65209:14"/>with <hi>Times paſt:</hi> and with the divers Revolutions, and Events of the numerous Ages before we were born, otherwiſe than by <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> from Hiſtory. If we would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our ſelves, whether the Books in our poſſeſſion, are indeed the Works of the Authors, whoſe Names they bear; that, which we muſt have recourſe to, is; that theſe Books have been, and are witneſſed to, are generally reputed to be thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Works; <hi>i. e. there's a general Tradition</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>For the two Reaſons given, it is plain; that there is both a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative <hi>ſafety,</hi> and likewiſe a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> (in a conſiderable meaſure) of reliance upon others <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and common <hi>Tradition,</hi> in many things.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding what has been ſaid on the <hi>behalf</hi> of Teſtimony and Tradition; yet they are not ſuch an <hi>Oracle,</hi> that their Reſponſes muſt be receiv'd <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65209:14"/>wary Examination. Though, where they <hi>well cannot</hi> miſtake, or deceive; or there's little, or <hi>no temptation</hi> to miſrepreſent things; they may be <hi>truſty,</hi> yet both Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> are often guilty of <hi>no ſmall failures.</hi> Of the two, <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> is ſubject to the more <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> and <hi>uncertainty.</hi> It is ordinary for <hi>Reports</hi> to paſs from one to another, to have a <hi>general</hi> Vogue; and yet to be <hi>very falſe.</hi> 'Tis uſual for Stories, which might be true enough in the <hi>firſt</hi> Relation of them, yet after they have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through many Mouths, to be ſo much altered from what they were at the firſt, that they look like one of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Metamorphoſes. There are Traditions from Fathers, which yet the Poſterity have not Faith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or more Wiſdom than to believe. It will be found upon due Conſideration, that, as when a Man hears others talking at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, only a noiſe, and now and then a word or two come to his Ears, the Articulation of the reſt being loſt by the way;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65209:15"/>inſomuch that little, if any thing is underſtood of what is ſaid: So that from paſt and remote Ages, there arrive down to us but meer <hi>generals;</hi> confus'd and very ſhort notices of things; and the Credit of thoſe too comes weakned with acknowledged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fabulous, or ſuſpected intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; eſpecially is this true of thoſe Antiquities, which <hi>meer Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> wafts to us.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve <hi>Families,</hi> one would think, that conſidering the love which Men have for their Native Soil, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place of their <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;</hi> for their <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and for the <hi>Stock,</hi> of which they are <hi>Branches; Young</hi> Perſons ſhould be much inquiſitive from their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> ſhould delight to Story to their <hi>Children,</hi> the Circumſtances pertaining to theſe things. Yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (excepting ſome <hi>general</hi> Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations) comparatively <hi>little News</hi> is brought of ſuch concerns, and of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi> which hapned but three or four Generations off; further than they can be certified from <hi>Regiſtries, Deeds,</hi> and the like Writings:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65209:15"/>'Tis not unuſual for Perſons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the <hi>Church-Book, how Old</hi> they are.</p>
                  <p>Books deſerve care; they are a relief of Mortality; in them the Dead Authors do in ſome manner ſurvive themſelves, and continue uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the world, after they have left it. Yet what a multitude of theſe has <hi>Tradition</hi> ſuffered to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to be <hi>buried</hi> as well as their <hi>Authors;</hi> nothing to be left of them, except (as an Epitaph) the <hi>Titles</hi> of them! Of many there remains no more than ſome <hi>fragmenta,</hi> ſome ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Limbs, as 'twere of a mangled Body. Several Books are <hi>father'd</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain <hi>Authors,</hi> of whom they have, it may be, no more than the <hi>Name.</hi> Divers are more or leſs <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;</hi> ſome <hi>ſo much</hi> depraved, <hi>ut ſamnium in ipſo ſamnio quaeratur,</hi> that the <hi>Books</hi> may be ſearch'd for in the <hi>very Books,</hi> and ſcarce <hi>found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that Tradition is not ſo careful a <hi>preſerver</hi> of it's <hi>Depoſita,</hi> as it <hi>ſhould be;</hi> not ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Relater of Things paſt, as that it ſhould be thought <hi>irrefragable;</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65209:16"/>and that <hi>Belief</hi> ſhould be ſubjected to it <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> and without choice. Therefore there muſt be <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> and beyond it, which may <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct</hi> us how to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Traditions; which to miſtruſt, or to reject; and which to believe.</p>
                  <p>This Director is <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which in it's Debate and Deciſion of the <hi>due Credibility</hi> of Teſtimonies and Traditions, and of the deſerv'd <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence</hi> of one to the other, proceeds upon the Circumſtances of the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers,</hi> and their <hi>qualifications.</hi> Theſe (in <hi>general</hi>) are, 1. A <hi>ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the things atteſted to: 2ly. <hi>Such Honeſty and Integrity,</hi> as may encline the Teſtifiers to relate things as <hi>they know</hi> them to be. Some of the <hi>particular</hi> Rules or Cautions, in the accepting Teſtimonies may be, 1. The <hi>More</hi> the Teſtifiers are, the <hi>ſtronger</hi> the Teſtimony is, and the <hi>More</hi> are to be preferr'd to the <hi>Fewer</hi> (ſuppoſing a Parity of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances:) 2ly. Foraſmuch as <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi> and the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of things, are commonly <hi>more eaſily</hi> knowable,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65209:16"/>and remembred, than <hi>Particulars</hi> and minuter Circumſtances, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Teſtimony may be more <hi>ſafely</hi> credited in the <hi>former</hi> than in the <hi>latter.</hi> 3ly. Becauſe Integrity is leaſt to be ſuſpected or queſtion'd, when not under temptation by Intereſt; therefore the Teſtimony of clear, and unintereſſed Witneſſes may be the more confidently admitted: 4ly. The nearer the Teſtifiers liv'd to the Times, in which what is witneſſed to, was ſpoken or done, the more valuable their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is, for the greater the remove is from what is Evidenced to, the more accidents might intervene for the clouding and miſrepreſentation of it.</p>
                  <p>By this it appears, that <hi>Reaſon's</hi> Court is the <hi>Soveraign Judicatory,</hi> where lies <hi>the laſt Appeal;</hi> here it being to be <hi>determin'd</hi> concerning the <hi>competency</hi> and <hi>validneſs</hi> of the Teſtimony or Tradition.</p>
                  <p>So much of <hi>Tradition</hi> in <hi>general</hi> (whoſe ſo near alliance to <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> at large makes them much to agree in their <hi>uſe and force;) what</hi> it is; in what <hi>matter</hi> moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I reply: (Omiting, that <hi>Tradition</hi> is not the <hi>only</hi> means of our <hi>Certitude</hi> about Scripture,) That the Exception does not invalidate what I have ſaid; for thus it is: We do confeſs to receive <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> upon the Church's <hi>univerſal Tradition;</hi> and we allow this <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to be (in it's kind) very <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>ſufficiently certain;</hi> and <hi>this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of Tradition, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> for the Intelligencing us concerning <hi>Scripture,</hi> is <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by us.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, before Reaſon can acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in a <hi>Tradition by Paſtors and Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> it muſt (according to what has been premis'd) be well ſatisfied <hi>in the fitneſs of the Teſtifiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Qualifications of Perſons for a due Teſtification (eſpecially in ſo weighty a matter as Religion) are, 1. Good <hi>knowingneſs of Fathers,</hi> and Anceſtors in Religion; as alſo <hi>due
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65209:22"/>care</hi> and diligence of Fathers in <hi>teaching their Children;</hi> together with good <hi>Apprehenſions, Memory, and Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> in the <hi>Children</hi> and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 2ly. Such a meaſure of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi> through <hi>all</hi> deſcents, as may ſecure the ſucceſſive Teſtifiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations unto ſwerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what they received from Fathers. Let theſe Qualifications be farther conſidered of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Requiſites are good Knowingneſs of Fathers, together with Care and Diligence; as alſo Apprehenſion, Memory, and Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in Children; let us examine how far theſe may be found <hi>in the Laiety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I believe, that the <hi>value and zeal</hi> for Religion in the <hi>firſt</hi> and golden Age of the Church made <hi>Fathers diligent</hi> to teach, and <hi>Youth</hi> to learn. But I doubt, that this Temper (as is incident to <hi>Religious Fervors)</hi> might <hi>cool</hi> afterwards; and that when Emperors became Chriſtians, <hi>Eaſe and Proſperity</hi> might beget a <hi>reſtiveneſs,</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> both in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and Poſterity. How well
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65209:23"/>Fathers of Families did perform their part, and how docile Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have been, <hi>throughout the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years</hi> before us, is out of our Ken. But if we may gueſs at times paſt (as there is often a likeneſs in ſome meaſure of the ways of Men in one Age, to thoſe in another) by the times preſent, and nearer to us, it is to be <hi>wiſhed,</hi> (I fear rather than it will be <hi>found</hi>) that <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>moſt</hi> Fathers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Families were ſuch as <hi>Abraham,</hi>

But theſe <hi>Rudiments</hi> are too ſlender <hi>a ſtock</hi> for Children to ſet up with, as <hi>qualified Conveyers</hi> of <hi>the Body of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And if even <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould paſs down long by <hi>word of Mouth,</hi> and <hi>not be Written,</hi> they would be in danger of <hi>Maims</hi> or <hi>Corruptions.</hi>

                  <p>When God made Man, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd him with ſuch a rectitude of Nature, as might enable him to glorifie his great Maker, and to attain to his own Happineſs. And when Man had by eating of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, contracted a general Ataxie of Soul, and particularly a great dimneſs of Underſtanding; God was pleaſed to relieve him, and to repair the decays of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what concern'd him for Spiritual and Eternal purpoſes: Eſpecially, doubtleſs God inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him (ſo far as he wanted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Information) about his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Unity, and how he would be Worſhipped. And queſtionleſs, the firſt Father of Mankind, and the ſucceeding Patriarchs, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently <hi>teach</hi> their Children, what they themſelves <hi>had received</hi> from God. And their exceeding long Lives gave them a peculiar oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> their <hi>Poſterities</hi> through ſeveral Generations; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65209:33"/>to <hi>recover</hi> them upon any <hi>revolt</hi> from primitive belief, or practice; and the <hi>extraordinary length</hi> of their lives was alſo equivalent to a <hi>greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of Traditioners. <hi>Adam,</hi> after the birth of <hi>Seth,</hi> liv'd 800 years, with his Children, and Childrens Children, and above 200 of thoſe 800 years with <hi>Methuſalah,</hi> whoſe death was but a very little before the period of the <hi>old World. Methuſalah</hi> was <hi>Noahs</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, very near 600 years. <hi>Noah</hi> (that <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs</hi>) ſurviv'd with his deſcendents 350 Years after the Flood. And before their <hi>diſperſion,</hi> and Plantation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places, They (eſpecially the <hi>Heads</hi> of the Colonies) had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and influenced by <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>juſt Man;</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> Gods familiarity with him, and ſpecial care over him, ought to have rendered <hi>moſt venerable,</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> very dutifully <hi>ſequacious</hi> of Him.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the two firſt Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were incomparably conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> were the greateſt <hi>Miracles</hi> that ever were. They could aſſure the World, that they had a Being, when as yet there was none of their own Kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65209:34"/>them: That they had near converſe with the God that <hi>made</hi> them, (the Man of the <hi>Duſt,</hi> the Woman of a <hi>Rib</hi> of the Man.) They could truly relate to their Children many ſtrange things of the World, its State before, and preſently upon Sin. And 'tis likely there was ſuch an <hi>Impreſs of Majeſty</hi> upon the Firſt <hi>Father</hi> of Mankind, and a <hi>Prophet</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls him) as might, and doubtleſs did, much <hi>awe</hi> his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into an <hi>obſequious Regard</hi> to what he told them. Then too in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> the drowning of the World in ſtupendious Waters, and the Confuſion of Tongues at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Babel</hi> were ſo <hi>rare and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Wonders,</hi>

                  <p>The Council of Conſtance procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their Decree, upon a <hi>Cuſtome rationally</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>introduced, for the avoiding dangers and ſcandals, or offences.</hi> But, 1. why they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on, and <hi>commend</hi> a Cuſtome as <hi>rational,</hi> which was in truth but an <hi>Innovation</hi> (becauſe contrary to the firſt Inſtitution of the Sacrament by Chriſt, and to the firſt and general uſe in the Churches of Chriſt, and therefore <hi>unreaſonable,</hi>) I cannot

Certainly, the Council had ſhew'd the Prudence and Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Fathers,</hi> if they had condemn'd this <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> as a <hi>Novel abuſe,</hi> and had done that <hi>Right</hi> to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to have <hi>reſtor'd</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to what it was at the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> But perhaps, 2ly.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65209:51"/>much. For, 1.

To avoid ſpilling, the Prieſt may put the leſs wine into the Chalice, and tread the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; this is an eaſi prevention of <hi>Irreverence.</hi> 3ly.

'Tis known, that wine is <hi>common,</hi> and ſufficiently <hi>cheap</hi> in thoſe places, where it is not made. Or if there be any odd Corner, where wine cannot be had, the third anſwer
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65209:52"/>may ſerve. So much for <hi>Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and the <hi>avoiding dangers and ſcandals.</hi>

The reaſon is, becauſe it can't be conceiv'd conſiſtent with our Lord's <hi>Wiſdom and Goodneſs,</hi> to have eſtabliſhed an <hi>univerſal Empire</hi> over Chriſtians in <hi>Peter</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and yet not to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and given a punctual <hi>Scheme</hi> of that Power and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſequently of Chriſtians due obedience and dependance; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that (as is pretended) ſuch a Power was deſign'd for the guidance and preſervation of all Chriſtians in Truth, Holineſs, and Peace: For the <hi>Papal Power</hi> without ſuch a clear <hi>ſtating</hi> of it, would be utterly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:65209:61"/>for attaining ſuch glorious Ends.

                  <p>Foraſmuch then as the <hi>Papacy</hi> is ſo tranſcendent an <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, in the <hi>claim</hi> of <hi>our Adverſaries;</hi> and that in plain <hi>reaſon,</hi> the <hi>fixation</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Pope's Inerrability,</hi> and of the juſt latitude of his <hi>Power,</hi> is ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> to a fit diſcharge of the <hi>Papal Office</hi> for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof of the <hi>Church;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was not wanting in the Revelation, and <hi>Communication</hi> of it to his Apoſtles and Church: Hence it follows, that becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are ſo uncertain, <hi>diſagree</hi> ſo much about it, therefore they <hi>differ</hi> among themſelves (not in Theological <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> or <hi>meer ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> niceties; but) in <hi>very grave</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Points (let them call them <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> or by what other names they pleaſe;) and which the Church was at the firſt inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>

                  <p>From the account, which has been given, it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Points,</hi> in which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> diſſent from one another, <hi>are Points of Faith;</hi> or elſe

                  <p>Thus in the foregoing pages, <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> has been tryed by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and by <hi>Experience;</hi> (the few paſſages of Scripture quoted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not intended for <hi>Proof</hi> of the Thing in <hi>Controverſie,</hi> but only us'd <hi>incidentally,</hi> and in a ſenſe which is obvious,) and is found <hi>guilty</hi> of ſo much <hi>uncertainty</hi> and <hi>failure,</hi> that it deſerves to be judg'd <hi>too inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to be truſted with the <hi>Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of divine Truths, down from their firſt Delivery through all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages.</p>
                  <p>But it may happen ſometimes, that there may be Arguments againſt <hi>a Thing,</hi> ſo plauſible, and which may have ſo ſtrong a ſeemingneſs of Demonſtration, as to engage the Judgment <hi>againſt it;</hi> and yet there may be Arguments too for it, ſo far more cogent, and convincing,

                  <p>'Tis confeſs'd, that the <hi>Faculties</hi> of Seeing and Hearing; the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Underſtanding, Will, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are <hi>from Nature,</hi> are <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> to us; that according to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>Nature,</hi> outward Objects

                  </p>
                  <p>But now, how <hi>ſhort</hi> is all this of a Proof, that <hi>Tradition</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> in the ſtrength of any <hi>Baſis</hi> it has in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man!

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I acknowledge that to be true, which is alleg'd in the juſt commendation of <hi>Religion;</hi> and that it does deſerve, and bind to a zeal, diligence, and ſincerity in the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, far above what Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on any worldly thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. I queſtion not alſo, but that the incomparable remarkable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion did fix deep, and indeleble Impreſſions on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the <hi>firſt Age;</hi> and on <hi>all</hi> afterwards, who have <hi>known</hi> how to value love, and tender it anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to its <hi>true worth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is that, at which I ſtop, <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether Chriſtians have in all Ages ſo cheriſh'd the even now named virtues for <hi>Religion,</hi> as to ſend it down to us without <hi>any</hi> diſguiſes, and in its <hi>genuine,</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65209:76"/>the <hi>moſt</hi> would be too prone to turn almoſt with every wind that ſhould blow, and to ſteer their Courſe thither, whence they might look for the greateſt Temporal eaſe, and advantage. And this Men might do, and yet

                  <p>From what has been diſcours'd, it follows, that the incomparable <hi>recommendableneſs</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>its obligingneſs</hi> to be believed, do not conclude a <hi>continued,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary obligation</hi> upon Children to believe their Parents through all Ages.</p>
                  <p>And yet ſuppoſe, that there were ſuch an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon Children to believe their Fathers; unleſs Children <hi>did believe</hi> ſuch an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incumbent on them, Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be ſtill <hi>failable.</hi> For then Children, Poſterity would take
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65209:76"/>the liberty to judge <hi>for themſelves,</hi> and to <hi>vary</hi> from the Fathers, as they ſhould ſee reaſon for it. Or if they ſhould believe <hi>as Fathers</hi> did, it would be <hi>caſual.</hi> Therefore (to make all ſure) 'tis

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot diſcern in all the following Pages of that Author, any <hi>proof</hi> of this, but only an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove an <hi>Obligation</hi> on thoſe in every Age to believe thoſe of the precedent Age.

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65209:77"/>
                  <p>But I can't diſcover any Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſuch a <hi>Belief</hi> of Poſterity concerning ſuch an <hi>Obligation.</hi> 'Tis well known, that antiently, and in ſeveral Ages of the Church, ſcarce a new Opinion could ſtart up, but it found Abettors. 'Tis ſtrange, if there were indeed ſuch a <hi>perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as is pretended, fix'd in the hearts of Chriſtians, that <hi>ſo often</hi> they ſhould have <hi>left</hi> the Road, and turn'd into an <hi>unbeaten</hi> Path in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages.</p>
                  <p>To come neerer to our own Times: <hi>The Relinquiſhers</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tenents and Communion; the Deſerters (as our Adverſaries call them) of Tradition, were (like the Croud in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion) <hi>a great Multitude, which no man can number, of many Nations and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, People, and Tongues:</hi> People <hi>divided</hi> by diverſity of Climates, and vaſt ſpaces of Earth and Seas; of various Complexions of Body, and Diſpoſitions of Soul; of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Education, manner of Life, and Civil Intereſts. This being unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably true, how utterly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65209:77"/>is it, that ſo many Myriads, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced by ſo <hi>many conſiderable</hi> Circumſtances, ſhould ſo <hi>unanimouſly</hi> agree in a departure from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church (<hi>i. e.</hi> in the Style of our Adverſaries, in a defection from Tradition), if there had really been ſuch a <hi>common</hi> Charm, and great Principle regnant among them, and <hi>uniting</hi> them in an Obſequious adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Fathers Faith, and in an <hi>oppoſition</hi> to any alteration of their Belief. Eſpecially, it is yet the more improbable, if it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that many of theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on a change through the <hi>ſharpeſt Perſecutions.</hi> And the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> of thoſe firſt Reformers have maintain'd the Seceſſion toward two Centuries of years, and are ſo well fatisfied in it, that they are <hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> averſe from a return to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion; unto which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>force</hi> is likely to reduce them, if <hi>even That</hi> can do it.</p>
                  <p>By this it appears, how highly improbable that Poſition is, <hi>viz. That it, is impoſſible, that Men ſhould not think themſelves obliged to believe,

                  </p>
                  <p>Or if a <hi>very great improbability</hi> be ſuppos'd, and that the Seceſſors from <hi>Rome had</hi> ſuch a Belief of a Tye upon them unto the Faith, and Practice of Anceſtors; then for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they <hi>acted contrarily</hi> to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: But howſoever, <hi>Act they did,</hi> and <hi>Counter</hi> to the Age <hi>then,</hi> and ſome Ages <hi>before.</hi> And even this will weaken Oral Tradition's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibility.</hi> For what hapned in <hi>this alteration,</hi> may have hapned <hi>in the Ages before:</hi> Tho' Children (ſuppoſe) <hi>did conceive an Obligation</hi> upon them to the ſame Faith with that of their Fathers, and becauſe it was their Fathers; yet if they <hi>might move</hi> contrarily to them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a <hi>believed</hi> engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there might be a Rupture in Tradition as ſurely, as if they <hi>had had no ſenſe</hi> of ſuch Obligation.</p>
                  <p>So that I do not ſee, if it ſhould be granted, that there had been (and were ſtill) in all Generations ſuch a <hi>perſuaſion</hi> of Poſterities <hi>Obligation</hi> to believe, and to practice juſt as Forefathers did, how ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65209:78"/>would quite do Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition's buſineſs. For tho' it may be well argued <hi>negatively;</hi> if Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did <hi>not conceive</hi> themſelves <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd</hi> to believe and to do as their Fathers did, there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Oral Tradition; yet it does not neceſſarily follow on the other ſide, and <hi>affirmatively;</hi> if ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Generations <hi>do believe</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves engag'd to believe, and to practiſe juſt as the foregoing did, therefore it will be ſure, that <hi>they will ſo</hi> believe and practiſe. The reaſon is, becauſe Men <hi>do not always,</hi> (nay too ſeldom) what they <hi>know</hi> it is their Duty to do. And tho' they, who <hi>firſt</hi> departed from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, might proceed <hi>againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of their <hi>Obligation</hi> to the contrary: yet their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> not diſcerning the <hi>manner</hi> of the firſt departure, might <hi>continue</hi> it (as the 200 Men followed <hi>Abſalom)</hi> in their <hi>ſimplicity;</hi> till <hi>continuance</hi> grew into a <hi>Preſcription,</hi> and gain'd the <hi>Port</hi> of Tradition.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding, that the ſo numerous Relinquiſhers of <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:65209:79"/>render it very improbable, that there was, or is a <hi>belief generally</hi> rooted in the minds of Men, that they are bound to believe, and to do conformably to Fathers; yet it may be perhaps ſaid (to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance this); that they, who keep <hi>ſtill conſtant</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, are remarkably <hi>numerous.</hi> And it is confeſs'd, they are too many. But it may rationally be queſtioned, whether all, or the greateſt part of them do ſtay in that Communion, <hi>out of a fix'd belief,</hi> that they are <hi>bound</hi> to believe as their Fathers did. I am ſure, <hi>their Being</hi> of that Church does not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſuch a <hi>Belief</hi> in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are divers <hi>other Cauſes,</hi> which may detain them on that ſide, <hi>beſides</hi> ſuch a perſuaſion; As Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Education, Prepoſſeſſion, and Wontedneſs to it; variety of great Preferments and Grandure, ſecular Pomp and Splendor; the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and pleaſingneſs of ſome Doctrines; fear from the Princes, who are Popiſh, and of Civil Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties; dread of Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65209:79"/>and of the Inquiſition.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſumm of this Section is this; 1. That it has not been proved, that there is an <hi>Obligation</hi> on Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to believe Forefathers, nay the <hi>contrary</hi> has been proved. 2ly.

That if they did conceive themſelves to be ſo obliged, yet it does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that they <hi>would move according</hi> to their <hi>Senſe</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Obligation.</hi> Therefore on this third Head there is not ſufficient ſecurity given for Oral Tradition's <hi>infallibility.</hi>

<note place="margin">P. 10, 11, 12.</note> That <hi>a deeper root, which greatly ſtrengthens, and reduces into action, the efficacity of Tradition, is; that Chriſtian Doctrine is not a ſpeculative knowledge, but it is an Art of living,—a practical Doctrine. —The conſequence of which is, that it is not poſſible, that any material Point of Chriſtian Faith can be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were by obreption, whileſt Men are on ſleep, but it muſt needs raiſe a great ſcandal, and tumult in the Chriſtian Common-weal.—We remember in a manner as yet, how Change came into</hi> Germany, France, Scotland, <hi>and our own Country. Let thoſe be a ſigne to us, what we may think can be the creeping in of falſe Doctrine; ſpecially, that there is no point of Doctrine contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, rooted in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nation, that the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory does not mention the times and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65209:80"/>combats by which it entred, and tore the Church in pieces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's another Argument for the <hi>great Efficacy</hi> of Tradition; in that it <hi>prevents Obreptions,</hi> ſo that the Church can't be aſſaulted by any material Error, but it is ſtrait A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum'd, and then ſtands upon its guard, and conſequently is in a capacity to defend, and to preſerve it ſelf. And this is one reaſon more, why <hi>the Church, receiving her Faith by Tradition, and not from Doctors,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 44.</note> hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept her entire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But firſt (to wave a conſideration, how <hi>little an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſome Doctrines cauſe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Practice,</hi> whether they are held pro, or con) it is deny'd, that it was <hi>not poſſible,</hi> that any <hi>material</hi> Point of Faith can be chang'd, as it were by <hi>Obreption,</hi>—but it muſt needs raiſe <hi>a great Scandal and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult</hi> in the Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal. For that there ſhould be a noiſe, and tumult in the Church, it was requiſite that there ſhould be a <hi>Breach of Communion,</hi> a ſeparation of one part from another. Thus
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65209:81"/>it hapned in the <hi>Arrian</hi> controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ſome others; there was a manifeſt ſiding, <hi>a departure</hi> of the Diſſenters from each other. Such was the Caſe too in <hi>Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. Several <hi>Corruptions</hi> had poſſeſs'd the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a long time; and that Church made the <hi>Profeſſion and Practice</hi> of thoſe corruptions, <hi>a Condition</hi> of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her; upon which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants <hi>withdrew</hi> from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; which occaſion'd the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the World; and the <hi>Guilt</hi> lies on them, who were the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the Breach, who gave the Offence.</p>
                  <p>But there may have been <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> in Doctrine, and Diſcipline too; and yet the Members of the Church have <hi>ſtill continued</hi> mutual Communion, and therefore <hi>no cry</hi> have been rais'd, little, if any, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> been taken; not becauſe of the <hi>little conſequence</hi> of the Doctrine or Practice; but (tho' it might be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi>) by reaſon of its <hi>ſurprizing manner</hi> of entrance. Some things in their <hi>firſt</hi> beginnings, becauſe <hi>ſmall,</hi> and in their <hi>progreſſes,</hi> becauſe

Are there not ſome <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> Diſeaſes, which make <hi>ſecret</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the Life, and <hi>undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd;</hi> till by <hi>more ſenſible</hi> effects and rudeneſs to Nature, they warn the Patient of his danger? Let us enquire, whether the like may not have hapned <hi>in Religion</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>It has not been uncommon for Perſons of buſie Parts, and good Credit for Virtue and Learning in their times, to have mov'd <hi>in a little Sphere of their own,</hi> to have held ſome Opinions againſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>general</hi> Vogue of the Age. Now, ſuppoſe one ſuch Perſon in Preaching or Writing, to have ſtarted a Doctrine. This coming into the Church, commended by the Reputation and plauſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Author, wins the good
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65209:82"/>liking of <hi>many,</hi> and is paſſable as a <hi>probable</hi> Opinion for ſome years: Till in the next Generation, through a <hi>wontedneſs</hi> to it, and a <hi>forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in what degree of aſſent it was <hi>at the firſt</hi> entertain'd, it comes to be believ'd <hi>as neceſſary.</hi> Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance would be the more facile, and likely, if the Doctrine were ſuch, as had not been expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd againſt in any general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, for then it would paſs with the greater ſhew of <hi>Modeſty;</hi> or were very <hi>advantageous,</hi> and particularly were ſuch to the <hi>governing Party</hi> in the Church (as ſuppoſe, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Supreme and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Domination of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> or that of Pardons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for then <hi>Intereſt</hi> would caſt another weight into the Scale; and it might be judg'd <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> to be believ'd <hi>as neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By a <hi>zealous ſtraining</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Practices, there might in time be <hi>a ſlip</hi> from the Mean, to an Extremity. The high and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd <hi>Veneration</hi> for the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper might <hi>occaſion</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65209:82"/>ſome <hi>lofty expreſſions</hi> of it, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential Geſtures</hi> at the Celebration of it. And then from the <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. might ariſe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Hoſt. There may have been very antiently a Solemn and Publick <hi>Commemoration</hi> of them, who dyed in the Lord, in way of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God for ſuch holy, uſeful Perſons; and of <hi>recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of them, as Religious <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars</hi> to the People. It may be, ſome too might <hi>pray</hi> for the Dead, out of a ſuperabundant <hi>Charity;</hi> yet not for a <hi>releaſe</hi> of them from Pains, but for a more <hi>ſpeedy conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of their begun bleſſedneſs. And hence in time might creep in an Opinion of a <hi>middle ſtate</hi> of the departed, and Prayers for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of Souls out of a <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fire.</hi> As the firſt Ages of the Church were Bleſſed with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Glorious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> ſo the Chriſtians of thoſe Ages had a very high and fitting <hi>eſteem</hi> of them. Sometimes it was an uſe <hi>to pray at</hi> the Monuments of the Martyrs;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65209:83"/>to addreſs them alſo with Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical <hi>Apoſtrophes;</hi> till at the laſt the Saints departed came to be <hi>prayed to,</hi> and to be <hi>Worſhipped.</hi> Thus it is intelligible enough, how there might be <hi>alterations</hi> in the Church's Doctrine and Practice, by <hi>ſtealth,</hi> and <hi>unobſervedly;</hi> and this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to oppoſe to the Authors (whom I quoted at the beginning of this Section); [<hi>it is not poſſible,</hi> that any material Point ſhould be chang'd, as it were by Obrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>ſecret</hi> and little notic'd <hi>Intruſion</hi> of Opinions, and Practices into the Church, will be found to have been the <hi>more feaſible;</hi> if we look back upon <hi>former Ages</hi> in it, and the Genius of them. For a great while Learning was very ſcarce, and Piety likewiſe. The Ignorance, Irreligion, and Debaucheries of the Laiety, and Clergy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, were ſo <hi>notorious</hi> in the eleventh, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Centuries, that they occaſion'd the great and loud

                  <p>IF we may collect the <hi>Judgment</hi> of Mankind from their <hi>Practice,</hi> we may believe, that in the <hi>Conveyance</hi> of Matters of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to Poſterity, they judge the Precedence due to <hi>Writings</hi> about <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> becauſe they ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65209:88"/>commit things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>Books,</hi> tho' they know the <hi>Books</hi> themſelves muſt be truſted with <hi>Tradition</hi> and Providence. How much more ſhould this Practice take place in <hi>Religion,</hi> which concerns Men as highly, as their <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> does! And beſides common <hi>Practice,</hi> there's great <hi>reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> things (eſpecially <hi>Religious</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Practices) ſhould be preferr'd to the hazarding them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cuſtody of <hi>Oral Tradition; That</hi> rather than <hi>This</hi> being the <hi>ſureſt means</hi> of their preſervation. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is much <hi>leſs difficult,</hi> becauſe there is much <hi>leſs requir'd,</hi> to keep a <hi>Book</hi> ſafe, and to hand it from one Generation to another, than to preſerve a great many of <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Senſes</hi> of that Book, and to <hi>tranſmit</hi> them from Age to Age unalter'd. To the former, meer plain <hi>honeſty,</hi> and an <hi>eaſie</hi> care are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Here's no need of much Apprehenſion, and Memory, and of a conſtant Care and Diligence to <hi>teach Poſterity;</hi> here's no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Poſterities ſcrupulous <hi>attention</hi> to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65209:88"/>teaching Fathers, and of an happy <hi>docility,</hi> or promptneſs to learn, and all this through a long ſeries of Ages. But theſe Punctilios (as has been ſhew'd before) are <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to a faithful and unerring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of Truths to after-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the <hi>way of Oral Tradition;</hi> therefore there is the more of <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,</hi> and conſequently the more <hi>likelihood of miſcarriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Books,</hi> if kept <hi>ſafe,</hi> do <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> preſerve what is depoſited with them. Their Memory (if I may ſo ſpeak) never fails them; there's no need of an operous care to teach them, or rather to remember them, what their Authors once told them, committed to them. They warp not with the Times, in which they are extant, tho' through ſeveral Generations. They are not ſubject to levity and wantonneſs of Judgment; nor to rebound from one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to another; not to a ſequaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs after Men, whoſe Parts ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them remarkable. They are not temptable by Hopes, or Fears. To be read, and to be accepted of, is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65209:89"/>their worſt Avarice or Ambition: Nor does the Paper or Parchment look the paler at a Rack or a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; or the Characters fly thence upon Perſecution. A Priſon can't ſcare them, they are us'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, to a Chain (it may be) in a Library. Thus it is with <hi>Books.</hi> But <hi>Oral Traditioners</hi> are expos'd to all thoſe <hi>inconveniences</hi> (as has been before manifeſted,) whence their <hi>Traditions</hi> are infected with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable <hi>crazineſs.</hi> Therefore for this ſecond, together with the firſt reaſon, <hi>Writings, Books,</hi> are the far <hi>leſs obnoxious;</hi> the more <hi>ſafe</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance. And what has been ſaid of Writings in <hi>general,</hi> is much more true <hi>particularly</hi> of the Sacred Scriptures.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt what has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered there may lye ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudice. It may be objected, that <hi>Writings</hi> have their fates, as well as their <hi>Authors.</hi> They are not exempt from either a <hi>total pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing</hi> by the oſcitancy and <hi>careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Owners, or by <hi>violence</hi> from Enemies. Or at leaſt they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65209:89"/>are liable to <hi>corruption;</hi> and that either <hi>wilful,</hi> and out of deſign (as, ſpeaking of Holy Scriptures, by Hereticks); or through the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or <hi>negligence</hi> of Tranſcribers. Whence it will follow, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the comparative <hi>eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of tranſmitting <hi>Writings,</hi> and the <hi>Fidelity</hi> of them, if preſerv'd; yet they may be raviſh'd by <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> from their Poſſeſſors, how <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> ſoever they be; or they may be <hi>loſt</hi> by them, if they ſhould prove <hi>careleſs;</hi> or they may be <hi>adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> upon one account, or another. And ſo <hi>Writings</hi> may not be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,</hi> or not preſerv'd <hi>ſincere</hi> and entire.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſpeaking of Scripture, and Tradition <hi>conjointly.</hi> I will begin with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Being preſt with Tradition, he anſwers, <hi>Whence is this Tradition? Deſcends it from our Lord's and his Goſpel's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or comes it from the Commands of the Apoſtles, and their Epiſtles? God declares, that thoſe things ſhould be done, which are written; ſaying to</hi> Joſhua, <hi>The Book of the Law ſhall not depart from thy Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h, but thou ſhalt meditate in it day and night; that thou mayeſt obſerve to do all things written in it. Likewiſe our Lord ſending his Apoſtles, Commands all Nations to be Baptized, and to be taught, that they obſerve all things, whatſoever
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65209:96"/>he had Commanded.—What obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, what preſumption is it, to prefer humane Tradition to the Divine Diſpoſe or Command; and not to conſider, that God is angry and in wrath, when hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition diſregards and diſſolves Divine Commands? As God warns and ſpeaks by the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And toward the end of the Epiſtle, —<hi>And this it behoves God's Prieſts to do at this time, keeping the Divine Commands, that if Truth have declin'd and fail'd in any reſpect, we go back to the ſource of the Evangelical and Apoſtolical Tradition, and let the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Actings take their riſe thence, whence their Order and Origin roſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preference of <hi>Scripture to Tradition</hi> by this antient Father, is ſo <hi>plain and undeniable,</hi> that it is reply'd, St. <hi>Cyprian's Teſtimony was writ by him to defend an Error;—and therefore no wonder, if</hi> (as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſays) more errantium ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinetur, <hi>he diſcours'd after the rate of thoſe that err; that is, aſſumes falſe grounds to build his Error on.</hi> Letter of Thanks, p. 124.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:65209:97"/>
                  <p>But this is a mean Evaſion. For tho' <hi>Cyprian</hi> was indeed in an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and did <hi>miſtake</hi> in his diſcourſe; yet it can't be affirm'd with <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> to ſuch a Saint, and Martyr; that to gratifie a <hi>private</hi> Opinion he would affront ſo Sacred and Catholick a <hi>Principle,</hi> as <hi>the Rule of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and degrade <hi>Tradition</hi> from being ſuch, if he had indeed <hi>believed</hi> it to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Yet if this ſhould be <hi>granted</hi> to our Adverſaries, the <hi>conſequence</hi> would be their <hi>inconvenience.</hi> For why might not <hi>more</hi> do the ſame, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did? and if <hi>ſome Fathers</hi> might deſert <hi>Tradition,</hi> and flye to <hi>Scripture,</hi> meerly to <hi>ſerve a Turn,</hi> for defence of an Opinion, which they could not maintain <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</hi> why may it not be as well ſaid, that <hi>other Fathers</hi> might baulk <hi>Scripture,</hi> and advance <hi>Tradition;</hi> and for <hi>the ſame end,</hi> viz. to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome Doctrine, or Doctrines, which elſe muſt have fallen?

                  <p>Why now, it is a wonder, that if God (tho' he provided his Church with the Holy Scriptures, yet) pleas'd to enſtate <hi>Oral humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> in the great Office of <hi>ſenſing Scripture,</hi> and of being <hi>the only Rule of Faith;</hi> He did not ſo order it, that Scripture ſhould <hi>modeſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> its Superior, but rather let <hi>Scripture</hi> carry away <hi>all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. A ſecond reaſon, why <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tradition</hi> can't plead ſo ſtrong a Title to a protection by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence,</hi> as <hi>Scripture,</hi> is this. God's Providence does <hi>ordinarily</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have prov'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>preſervation</hi> of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>proper Cauſes</hi> of ſuch an Effect; cauſes miniſterial, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; <hi>humane</hi> care and vigilancy, and <hi>Divine</hi> ſpecial Providence.</p>

                  <p>So that there is not a Tenent, which we have more <hi>ſtrong induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to believe, upon the account even of <hi>Tradition,</hi> than that the <hi>Divine Books</hi> (the Scriptures, which we have) are indeed the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and have been <hi>faithfully</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us from the <hi>beginning;</hi> there being <hi>no Tradition</hi> more <hi>univerſal</hi> for any Point than for <hi>this</hi> great important Truth; tho' Chriſtians

                  <p>I conclude then, ſeeing that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are much more fit to keep the Truths committed to them ſafe, than <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> if they be preſerved; (as has been prov'd) and likewiſe that the Holy Scriptures <hi>are</hi> preſerv'd (as is <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> confeſs'd, and even by <hi>our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries);</hi> it muſt follow, that <hi>not Oral Tradition,</hi> but <hi>the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the ſureſt and ſafeſt way of Conveyance of Divine Truths down from their Original delivery unto us;</hi> which to demonſtrate was the <hi>ſcope</hi> of this Undertaking.</p>

                  <p>That, which makes the noiſe of <hi>Scriptur's obſcurity</hi> the more <hi>loud,</hi> is, that Men are apt to look upon the many <hi>ſubtilties</hi> of the Schooles, and <hi>Niceties</hi> of Polemick Writers, as <hi>Articles of Faith;</hi> and that men have more mind to fathom <hi>depths,</hi> and to humour their <hi>curioſity</hi> (for which end, I believe, the Scriptures were not intended), and hence, are ever racking the Scriptures and vexing the Sacred Text; than to exerciſe themſelves in a <hi>ſober</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what is ſufficiently <hi>plain,</hi> and in a conſciencious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the <hi>Holy Rules of Life,</hi> which are <hi>evident</hi> enough.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have raiſed a cry of Scriptur's <hi>darkneſs</hi> upon <hi>another</hi> account, and out of <hi>Policy.</hi> For having embrac'd ſeveral Tenents and Practices, which <hi>Scripture</hi> does condemn, or not countenance (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is wholly ſilent of them, or they are but meer appearances there, which are ſnatch'd at); and yet it is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or profit, or the affected reputation of an infallibility, to part with; they are faine to preſs <hi>Tradition</hi> to ſerve in their Wars, and for <hi>the defence</hi> of them.
